# dotfile management

Uses the bare repo approach outlined here: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles

# TODO

* Migrate from my old zsh_config repo over to this... mostly scrapping/fixing the setup.sh
* Migrate off of antibody, I think I can just use brew to install `powerlevel10k`, `zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions`, `zsh-users/zsh-completions`
